# Firmware

This code tested with two firmware versions:

1. `Master_Firmware_Triax_V8_01-25-2023_V1_40` (version 1.40)
2. `Master_Firmware_Triax_V8_09-28-2023_V2_20` (version 2.20)

The latter allows for a gain of 0.1x to be set, although measuring fields greater than 4 or 5 nT will result in a very non-linear response and will introduce significant error (without correction) into the QZFM readback.
